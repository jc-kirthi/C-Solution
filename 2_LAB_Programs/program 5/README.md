### *Array ?*
- It is a collection of similar data types stored at contiguous memory locations.
1. 1D : Linear list of data items of same type which are stored contiguously in memory (means arranged one after the other, without any gaps in between).
2. 2D : Table of data items of similar data type with 2 subscripts stored contiguously in memory

### *Sorting ?*
- It is a technique to arrange data in a specific order â€” either ascending or descending.

### *Swapping ?*
- It means exchanging the values of two variables.

### *Bubble Sort ?*
- It is a sorting technique which repeatedly compares two adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

### *Tracing ?*
- It means checking the step-by-step execution of code.
- In sorting, we trace the values of the array after each pass to understand how the elements are moving toward the correct order.
