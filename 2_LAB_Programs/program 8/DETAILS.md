# Title
Design and Develop a C program using pointers to compute the sum, mean and standard deviation of all elements stored in an array of n real numbers. 
# Problem Description
The program should prompt the user to input the number of elements n and the array elements. Using pointer arithmetic and mathematical formulas, the program should calculate the sum, mean, and standard deviation of the array elements.  
# Method
Exploration of pointers and pointer arithmetic in C.

### *Pointer ?*
- A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable.
- It points to the location of data in memory.
- ' * ' is used to declare a pointer and ' & ' to get the address.

### *First Element of an Array ?*
- The first element of an array is at index 0.
- Its address is also the base address of the array.
- arr(array's name) and & arr[0] gives the same memory address.
### *Standard Deviation Formula ?*
SD = sqrt( ( Σ (xᵢ - x̄)² ) / n )

Where:
- xᵢ = each data value
- x̄  = mean of the data
- n   = total number of values
