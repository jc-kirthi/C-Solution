# Title:
Design and Develop a C program to perform binary Search using user defined functions. 
# Problem Description:
The program should prompt the user to input elements into a one dimensional array and a target value to search for within the array.  
# Method: 
Use 1D array to store the integer elements.
<br>
Also, use user defined functions to implement the logic of binary search by passing reference.

### *Searching ?*
- It means finding the position or presence of a particular value (called a key or target) in a list or array.

### *Linear Search ?*
- It is a basic method where we check each element one by one in the array from start to end until we find the target.
- It works on unsorted or sorted arrays, but it is slow for large data.

### *Binary Serach ?*
- It is an efficient searching technique used on a sorted arrayonly.
- It works by repeatedly dividing the array into two halves and comparing the middle element with the target.
- Because it divides the array in half each time, it needs fewer iterations compared to linear search.
