# Title
Design and Develop a C program for an electricity board to calculate charges based on electricity usage. The program should prompt the user to input their name and the number of units consumed.  
# Problem Description
 Using a tiered pricing structure, calculate the charges as follows: 

• For the first 200 units, charge 80 paise per unit 

• For the next 100 units (201 to 300), charge 90 paise per unit. 

• Beyond 300 units, charge Rs 1 per unit. 

Additionally, apply a minimum meter charge of Rs. 100 to all users. If the total amount exceeds Rs 400, include a 15% surcharge. 

Display the user's name and the total charges incurred, accounting for the surcharge if applicable.

### *if-else-if ladder ??*
- It is an alternative to switch case.
- Used when we have multiple conditions to check one after the another.

### *char [value] ?*
- It is an array of characters used to store a string.<br>
- value: defines the limit of the characters that can be stored including space.<br>
- Ends with a special null character \0.
- \0 tells the compiler where the string ends.

### *gets() ?*
- It is a function used to take a full line of string input including spaces.

### *Variable ?*
- It is a named memory location used to store data that can change during program execution.
- It allows the programmer to reuse and manipulate values in the program.
