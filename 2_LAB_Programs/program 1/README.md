# Title
Design and Develop a C program to solve simple computational problems using arithmetic expressions and use of each operator leading to simulation of a commercial calculator.
# Problem Description 
The program should prompt the user to input an arithmetic expression, the calculator should support the following operators: Addition (+), subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), Division(/) and modulus (%) and also should handle the error such as division by zero , unrecognized operator.
# Method 
### Switch Statement

### *Switch case ?*
- It is a multi-way branch control statement that allows the execution of different code blocks based on the values.
- It is an alternative to ladder if-else-if.

### *Exit(0) function ?*
- This function is available under <stdlib.h> header file.
- It terminates (comes out of) the program immediately.
 
### *Library ?*
- It contains pre-defined functions which can be used directly.

### *Header File ?*
- It contains function declarations and guides compiler.<br>
- For Example:
   - #include <stdio.h> allows us to use functions like printf() and scanf()

### *Algorithm ?* 
- It is a step-by-step procedure or set of instructions to solve a specific problem or perform a task.
