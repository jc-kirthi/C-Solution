### *Structures ?*
- It is a user-defined data type in C that allows you to group different types of variables under one name.
- It is useful when you want to store data like a record.

### *Union ?*
- A union is similar to a structure, but in a union, all members share the same memory location.
- It can hold only one value at a time to save memory.
