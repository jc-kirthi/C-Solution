### *File Handling ?*
- It is the process of creating, reading, writing, and manipulating files stored on the disk.
- It allows a program to store data permanently, even after the program ends.

### *FILE ?*
- It is a structure defined in the <stdio.h> library that stores all information about a file (like file pointer, name, mode, etc.).
- It acts as a bridge between the file on disk and the program.

### *FILE *fp; ?*
- It is a file pointer used to point to the file structure.
- It is used to access and control the file in our code.

### *Formatted Input/Output ?*
- It uses format specifiers to read or display data in a structured way.
- These functions allow us to control the format of input/output using placeholders like %d, %f, %s, etc.
- Examples:
   - printf() – for displaying output
   - scanf() – for reading input
   - fprintf(), fscanf() – for file input/output

### *Unformatted Input/Output ?*
- It is used to read or write raw characters or strings without using format specifiers- usually character-by-character or string-wise.   
- Examples:
  - getchar(), putchar() – for single characters
  - gets(), puts() – for strings 
  - fgetc(), fputc() – for reading/writing single characters from/to a file
