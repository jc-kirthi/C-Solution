# Title
Design and Develop a C Program using functions to compute Sin(x) using Taylor series approximation. Compare your result with the built- in Library function. Print both the results with appropriate messages. 
# Problem Description 
The program should prompt the user to input the angle x, then calculate its sine value using the Taylor series expansion.  
# Method 
### do-while loop

### *do-while loop ?*
- It is a loop that runs at least once, even if the condition is false.
- It checks the condition after running the code block.

### *Series ?*
- It is a sequence of numbers or terms added together usually based on a formula or pattern.

### *Taylor Series ?*
- It is a way to approximate functions like sin(x), cos(x), exp(x) using a sum of terms made from derivatives.
- It helps us express a complex function as a polynomial.

### *sin(x) Function ?*
- It is an built-in function from the math.h library used to calculate the sine of an angle in radians.
